# Currency Stat

this is an API that tracks the movements of currency pairs in the forex market.

## Getting Started 

Getting there...

## Steps to create the API

### Set up the backend to pull data from Oanda API

Do statistics on the currency pairs from the Oanda API data

### Set up the API using Django or Flask

Calling the API should call the Oanda API too, getting data from Oanda,
and then doing statistics on that data to send back to the user.

### Build A cool website exhibiting the power of our API

Use React to build a website that showcases the API

### Add Hashicorp Vault to keep API key secrets

Keep the Oanda API secrets in a vault that we can use to inject into 
the project. This may require you to use Kubernetes (you get a free cluster on GCP I think).

### Dockerize the project

Dockerize it!

## So Far...

```
pip install flask
